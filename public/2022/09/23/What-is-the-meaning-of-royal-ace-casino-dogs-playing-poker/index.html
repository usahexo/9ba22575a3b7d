Therefore, when a group of soldiers are playing poker, the one with the most aces is considered to be the royal ace.</p>
<p>There are other theories about the meaning of this phrase, but this seems to be the most logical explanation. Some people believe that it refers to a specific incident in which a group of soldiers were caught playing poker while on duty. Others think that it may be a reference to an old saying about how dogs will play poker but lions will hunt. However, there is no concrete evidence to support either of these interpretations.</p>
<p>So what does this phrase actually mean? Unfortunately, we may never know for sure. However, it’s still an interesting piece of slang that has been used for centuries. If you ever come across it in conversation, you’ll now know its true meaning!</p>

<h1 id="Who-are-the-dogs-in-Dogs-Playing-Poker"><a href="#Who-are-the-dogs-in-Dogs-Playing-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Who are the dogs in Dogs Playing Poker?"></a>Who are the dogs in Dogs Playing Poker?</h1><p>The 1894 painting Dogs Playing Poker by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge is one of the most famous examples of American Art. The painting has been reproduced countless times and is considered a classic in Americana culture. It’s also the source of much speculation and mystery. While the identities of all the dogs in the painting are unknown, there are many theories about who they may be.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that each dog is a representation of a different type of gambler. For example, the bulldog may be a symbol for the reckless gambler, while the white pointer may represent the shark that preys on novice gamblers. Another popular interpretation is that each dog is representing a different stage in human life. The bulldog may represent infancy, the dachshund adolescence, and so on.</p>
<p>A third, and more recent theory, suggests that each dog is actually a real person who was painted into the scene by Coolidge. This theory is based on circumstantial evidence, such as Coolidge’s habit of including his friends in his paintings. However, there is no concrete proof to support this claim.</p>
<p>While we may never know for sure who Coolidge intended to represent in his painting, it continues to be one of America’s most iconic pieces of art.</p>

One reason is that it is fun and a way to pass the time. They may also be playing for stakes, such as food or treats. Some people believe that the dogs are actually gambling, and that they represent different human character traits. For example, the dog in the back may be representing the gambler, while the dog next to him may be representing the victim of the gambler.</p>
