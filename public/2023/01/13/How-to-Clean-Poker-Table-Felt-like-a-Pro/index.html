Whether you’re trying to remove stubborn stains or just give the entire surface a good clean, this guide will help you do it like a pro.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by vacuuming the table top to get rid of any loose dirt or debris. This will make the next step a lot easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, mix up a bucket of hot water and laundry detergent. The hotter the water, the better, as it will penetrate any stains better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dip a soft cloth into the detergent mixture and start scrubbing the table top in a circular motion. Be sure to pay special attention to any particularly dirty areas.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rinse the cloth frequently and change the water in the bucket as needed until the table top is clean. Dry it off with another soft cloth once you’re finished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you notice any stubborn stains that didn’t come out with regular cleaning, there are a few other methods you can try. One popular method is to use acetone nail polish remover on a cotton ball; just be sure to test this on an inconspicuous area first to make sure it doesn’t damage the felt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another option is hydrogen peroxide mixed with baking soda; again, test this in an inconspicuous area before using it on the entire table top.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, if all else fails, you can buy a commercial stain remover specifically designed for poker table felt from your local sporting goods store or online retailer.</p>

<p>The first step is to remove all of the chips and cards from the table. Once everything is removed, use a vacuum cleaner or broom to remove any loose debris from the surface of the felt. Be sure to pay close attention to any areas that seem to be collecting more dirt than others.</p>
<p>Next, use a wet cloth or sponge to wipe down the entire surface of the felt. Start by dampening the cloth with warm water, then apply a small amount of soap (such as dishwashing liquid) before wiping down the entire surface. Be sure to clean both sides of the felt and pay special attention to any areas that seem dirty or stained.</p>

<h1 id="A-Proven-Method-for-Cleaning-Poker-Table-Felts"><a href="#A-Proven-Method-for-Cleaning-Poker-Table-Felts" class="headerlink" title="A Proven Method for Cleaning Poker Table Felts"></a>A Proven Method for Cleaning Poker Table Felts</h1><p>You’ve probably seen those poker tournaments on TV where the table felts are absolutely filthy by the end of the game. If you’re like me, you may have even wondered how they manage to get them so clean. Well, wonder no more! I’m going to show you a simple and effective method for cleaning your poker table felt.</p>
<p>The first thing you need is some dish soap. Any kind will do, but I recommend using something that’s tough on grease and grime. Dawn dish soap is a good choice.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need a gallon of hot water and a bucket.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to get to work! Fill the bucket with hot water and add a few squirts of dish soap. Stir the water until the soap is dissolved.</p>
<p>Next, wet your rag in the water and start scrubbing the felt. Be sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. Scrub gently at first, then apply more pressure as needed.</p>
<p>When you’re finished scrubbing, rinse the rag in the bucket and wipe down the entire table surface. Rinse the bucket and dump out any excess water. Let the table dry completely before using it again.</p>
