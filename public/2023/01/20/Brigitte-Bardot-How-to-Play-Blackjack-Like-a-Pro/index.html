<h1 id="Play-blackjack-like-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#Play-blackjack-like-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="Play blackjack like Brigitte Bardot"></a>Play blackjack like Brigitte Bardot</h1><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Brigitte Bardot reigned as one of the world’s most iconic sex symbols. Her pillowy lips, large doe eyes, and coquettish demeanor caught the hearts of many a man — including some of the world’s most powerful.</p>
<p>But beneath Bardot’s seductive allure was a woman with a sharp mind and an unrivaled passion for blackjack. She regularly frequented casinos in Paris and Monte Carlo, where she developed her own winning blackjack strategy.</p>
<p>Now, decades later, you can use Bardot’s techniques to beat the casino at its own game. Here are three tips from the legendary siren:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stick to simple bets</li>
</ol>
<p>Bardot was never one for complex betting systems. Instead, she stuck to simple bets like even or odd numbers, red or black cards, or high or low values. This kept things simple and allowed her to focus on her gameplay.</p>
<p>You can do the same by avoiding complicated wagers and sticking to basic ones like pass line or don’t pass in craps, blackjack hits or stand, or betting on the ball landing on odd or even numbers in roulette.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Keep track of your cards</li>
</ol>
<p>Bardot was famous for her card counting abilities. She would keep track of every card that was played, using this information to make informed decisions about when to hit or stand.</p>
<p>You can do the same by tracking the cards as they’re dealt. This can be done mentally or by using a card counting system like Hi-Lo or The Zen Count. By knowing what’s left in the deck, you can make smarter choices about your next move.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use distractions wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Bardot was a master of using distractions to her advantage. She would chat up dealers and other players at the table, all while keeping an eye on her cards and making strategic moves.</p>
<p>You can use distractions to your advantage too by chatting up dealers and other players at the table (just be sure not to reveal any important information about your hand). You can also watch other games going on around you or listen to music to help keep your focus sharp.</p>
