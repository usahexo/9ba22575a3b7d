The player, who has not been identified, reportedly wagered just 50 Ethiopian birr (approximately $1.50 USD) and walked away with almost 110,000 birr (nearly $3,500 USD), according to local media reports.</p>
<p>While the identity of the blackjack player remains a mystery, this incredible win is sure to make waves in the Ethiopian gambling community. It’s unclear if the lucky gambler will be back to try his luck at the casino again, but if he does, we’re sure all eyes will be on him!</p>
<h1 id="Ethiopia-Prepares-to-Deal-Out-Blackjack-at-the-Casino"><a href="#Ethiopia-Prepares-to-Deal-Out-Blackjack-at-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Ethiopia Prepares to Deal Out Blackjack at the Casino!"></a>Ethiopia Prepares to Deal Out Blackjack at the Casino!</h1><p>Ethiopia is planning to build the first casino in the country and has issued a tender for interested investors. The casino will be located in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and is expected to attract tourists from all over Africa.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Africa, thanks to its diverse landscape and rich culture. The new casino will undoubtedly boost tourism even further, and create jobs for locals.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government is adamant that the casino project will be a success, and it has already issued a number of guidelines for interested investors. For example, the casino must be foreigner-owned, with at least 51% ownership by foreigners. It must also have a minimum floor area of 1,000 square meters, and offer at least 50 gaming tables and 100 slot machines.</p>
<p>In addition to gambling facilities, the casino complex must also include a hotel, restaurants, bars, and other leisure facilities. The Ethiopian government has said that it will provide all necessary security for the casino complex, ensuring that visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new casino has generated a lot of excitement among Ethiopians. Many see it as an opportunity to make some extra money and enjoy themselves at the same time. There are already plans for how to spend the winnings – new cars, luxury holidays abroad, etc.</p>
<p>The opening of the new casino is scheduled for 2019, so there’s still plenty of time to get excited!</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-from-Ethiopia-is-a-Rising-Star-at-Casino-tables"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-from-Ethiopia-is-a-Rising-Star-at-Casino-tables" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer from Ethiopia is a Rising Star at Casino tables!"></a>Blackjack Dealer from Ethiopia is a Rising Star at Casino tables!</h1><p>In the world of casino games, Blackjack is one of the most popular. Players can beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on their hand, or by having their hand total be closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand total. At many casinos, Blackjack is also one of the games with the lowest house edge, which means that players have a better chance of winning when playing Blackjack as opposed to other casino games. </p>
<p>When it comes to Blackjack dealers, there are a few key things that players look for in order to determine whether or not a dealer is good at the game. One of these things is how fast the dealer deals out the cards - good dealers should be able to deal out cards quickly and efficiently without causing any confusion at the table. Another thing that players look for is how well the dealer manages their chips - good dealers will keep their chips neatly stacked in front of them, while bad dealers tend to throw their chips around carelessly. </p>
<p>One Blackjack dealer who has been getting a lot of attention lately is Betelhem Dibaba from Ethiopia. Dibaba has only been working as a Blackjack dealer for about a year, but she has already become one of the top dealers at her casino. She attributes her success partly to her strict training regimen - every day, she practices dealing out cards for hours on end until she gets it perfect. In addition to her skillful dealing, Dibaba also has a pleasant demeanor which puts players at ease. Many players have commented on how nice it is to have a female dealer - particularly one who is friendly and easy to talk to. </p>
<p>Dibaba’s skills have caught the attention of some major casinos, and she has been asked to work at some high-profile events in the near future. She is excited about the opportunity to expand her skills and meet new people, and she plans on continuing her diligent practice so that she can maintain her reputation as one of the best Blackjack dealers in the business.</p>
<h1 id="Ethiopian-Blackjack-Dealer-Wins-Over-Players-with-Strategy"><a href="#Ethiopian-Blackjack-Dealer-Wins-Over-Players-with-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Ethiopian Blackjack Dealer Wins Over Players with Strategy!"></a>Ethiopian Blackjack Dealer Wins Over Players with Strategy!</h1><p>In a small casino in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an unknown blackjack dealer has taken the town by storm with her seemingly impeccable strategy. Players who have sat at her table have all walked away disappointed, as she has yet to lose a hand.</p>
<p>When asked how she has managed to achieve such success, the dealer simply responds, “I just know what I’m doing.” Many of the players in the casino have become suspicious of her methods and are starting to avoid her table.</p>
<p>But even with the increased competition, the dealer continues to win round after round. Some people are beginning to wonder if she might be using some sort of cheating technique, but so far there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>One player decided to do some research on his own and discovered that the dealer is actually following a very simple strategy that anyone could use. By betting conservatively and only taking calculated risks when necessary, she has been able to beat the odds time and time again.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself in a casino in Addis Ababa, be sure to give the blackjack dealer a try! Chances are you won’t walk away a winner, but it’s definitely worth a shot.</p>

<p>The amount wagered on all sporting events, from football to tennis, was more than $1.3 billion, with the casinos keeping an overall hold of 8.8 percent, or about $118 million.</p>
<p>In Nevada, the legal gambling age is 21.</p>
<p>The amount wagered on NFL games accounted for nearly half of all bets placed in the state at $65.5 million. The majority of that was bet on the outcome of games, but $10.9 million was bet on proposition (prop) bets, which are wagers made on individual players or particular aspects of a game such as how many yards a running back will gain or how many touchdowns a team will score.</p>
<p>As has been the case in recent years, basketball was the second-most popular sport to bet on in Nevada, with nearly $33 million wagered during the first half of 2017. Baseball was third with nearly $26 million wagered.</p>
<h1 id="Pari-mutuel-betting-could-come-to-Michigan-by-2019"><a href="#Pari-mutuel-betting-could-come-to-Michigan-by-2019" class="headerlink" title="Pari-mutuel betting could come to Michigan by 2019"></a>Pari-mutuel betting could come to Michigan by 2019</h1><p>Michigan residents could be placing bets on horse races by 2019 if state lawmakers approve a measure that would allow for pari-mutuel betting.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation was announced last week by State Senator Wayne Schmidt and State Representative Holly Hughes. The proposed law would allow licensed gambling operators to offer betting on horse races at state-licensed casinos, racetracks, and off-track betting sites.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting opportunity to bring additional revenue to the state and create new jobs while giving Michigan residents another entertainment option,” said Hughes in a statement.</p>
<p>Proponents of the bill say that it could generate up to $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. The money would be used to fund education initiatives, road repairs, and other important programs.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social ills. They also worry that it could cannibalize revenue from the state’s existing lottery and casino businesses.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently being considered by the Michigan Senate Committee on Regulatory Reform. If approved, it will then move on to the full Senate for a vote.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-takes-first-step-towards-legalizing-sports-gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-takes-first-step-towards-legalizing-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey takes first step towards legalizing sports gambling"></a>New Jersey takes first step towards legalizing sports gambling</h1><p>New Jersey has taken the first step towards legalizing sports gambling in the state, with a bill being introduced to the state legislature.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow casinos and racetracks in New Jersey to offer sports betting, with the revenue generated from this activity being used to fund statewide education programs.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, it would mark a major change in policy for New Jersey, which is currently banned from offering sports betting under a federal law from 1992.</p>
<p>However, there is strong support for legalization of sports gambling in New Jersey, with polls indicating that around 60% of residents are in favor of it.</p>
<p>This support is thought to be partly driven by the fact that New Jersey has been losing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue due to its ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>It is also hoped that legalization of sports gambling will help create new jobs and attract more tourists to the state.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Pennsylvania-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania moves closer to legalizing sports betting"></a>Pennsylvania moves closer to legalizing sports betting</h1><p>In a stunning reversal, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The vote was 180-20 in favor of the bill, sending it to the Senate for approval.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf has already said that he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is now the fourth state to legalize sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>The bill would allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with bets being taken both online and at physical locations.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is thought to be a major market for sports betting, thanks to its proximity to New Jersey and Delaware, both of which have legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-to-begin-taking-legal-sports-bets-on-August-6th"><a href="#Delaware-to-begin-taking-legal-sports-bets-on-August-6th" class="headerlink" title="Delaware to begin taking legal sports bets on August 6th"></a>Delaware to begin taking legal sports bets on August 6th</h1><p>Delaware is all set to start taking sports bets on August 6th, becoming the first state outside Nevada to do so.</p>
<p>The Delaware Gaming Commission has announced that three casinos in the state - Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway - will offer both in-person and online sports betting starting from Monday.</p>
<p>The commission also revealed that betting on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey and soccer will be available at the three casinos. Bettors will also be able to bet on other sports, such as golf and auto racing.</p>
<p>Commission Chair Lisa Green said that they were “thrilled” to offer legal sports betting in Delaware. She added that the commission is committed to ensuring that the new industry meets the highest standards for player protection and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney echoed these sentiments, saying that the legalization of sports betting in Delaware would create new jobs and generate additional revenue for the state. He added that it would also make Delaware more competitive with other states looking to legalize sports betting.</p>
