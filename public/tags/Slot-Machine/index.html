<p>Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil has been fined £10 million by the English Football Association for violating its betting rules. The German international was found to have placed bets on football matches using a Microgaming sportsbook.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Ozil has been in trouble with the FA. In October of last year, he was banned for one game and fined £25,000 for making a Nazi salute in celebration of a goal he scored.</p>
<p>Arsenal released a statement saying that they “condemn Ozil’s actions in the strongest possible terms”. The club also said that they would be imposing their own internal disciplinary measures on the player.</p>
<p>Microgaming also released a statement, saying that they “do not tolerate any form of cheating or fraudulent behaviour”. The company added that they are working closely with the FA to ensure that all betting regulations are adhered to.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Beckham alleged that Microgaming withheld payments owed to him as part of a promotional deal. The former England captain also criticised the company for refusing to allow him to withdraw winnings from his account.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Friday, Microgaming denied all of Beckham’s allegations, insisting that the company had “always acted fairly and responsibly” towards him. The statement went on to say that the payments withheld from Beckham were in fact part of an advance on future royalties, and not salary payments as he had claimed.</p>
<p>Microgaming also claimed that Beckham had been fully aware of the terms of the promotional deal involved and that he had never requested to withdraw any winnings from his account.</p>
<h1 id="Footballer-loses-12-million-pounds-in-gambling-scandal"><a href="#Footballer-loses-12-million-pounds-in-gambling-scandal" class="headerlink" title="Footballer loses 12 million pounds in gambling scandal"></a>Footballer loses 12 million pounds in gambling scandal</h1><p>One of the world’s best football players has lost nearly 12 million pounds in a gambling scandal. The player, who has not been identified, is said to have bet on soccer matches and other sporting events over a four-year period.</p>
<p>It is believed that he lost most of the money while betting on games in Asia. The revelation is a major embarrassment for the player, who is one of the top earners in global football.</p>
<p>He was said to have placed high-value bets with online bookmakers, including some that were not even licensed in Britain. In total, he is thought to have lost around £11.7 million ($15 million).</p>
<p>The news comes as a major blow to the player, who is currently recovering from a serious knee injury. He was sidelined for several months after undergoing surgery in November.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the player has confirmed that he lost money through gambling, but refused to give any further details. The spokesman added that the player is now “working hard to rectify the issue”.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the player will face any disciplinary action from his club or governing body over the gambling revelations.</p>

<p>The allegations surfaced earlier this month, when it was revealed that a number of Microgaming employees had sold their shares in the company shortly before its share price fell by 14%.</p>
<p>Alexander insisted that the company acted lawfully at all times, and that the employees who sold their shares did so independently and without knowing about the forthcoming price crash.</p>
<p>“We have done nothing wrong,” said Alexander. “Our employees are free to sell their shares at any time, and they were not aware of any information that would have led them to believe that the share price would fall.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that he was confident that the matter would be resolved quickly and positively.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Microgaming has been embroiled in a controversy surrounding insider trading. In 2007, two employees were charged with insider trading after they sold £1.5 million worth of shares shortly before the company announced poor financial results.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old England international is believed to have lost the money playing games such as Mega Moolah, Major Millions and Tunzamunni at online casinos.</p>
<p>After his high-rolling ways were uncovered by the club’s board, the player was given the boot and forced to pay back the millions he had squandered.</p>
<p>Microgaming is a software provider for online casinos that offer a wide range of games, including slots, roulette and blackjack. The company has become popular with players thanks to its huge jackpots, which can often reach into the millions of pounds.</p>

<p>The study, which was published in the journal <em>PLOS One</em>, looked at how social media and other forms of online communication can contribute to problem gambling.</p>
<p>Researchers analyzed data from a survey of more than 2,000 people who had either a problem with gambling or were considered at risk of developing a problem. They looked at how participants used social media and other forms of online communication, as well as how much time they spent on these activities.</p>
<p>The findings showed that those who spent more time on social media and other forms of online communication were more likely to have a problem with gambling. In particular, using social media to communicate with friends about gambling was linked with an increased risk of developing a problem.</p>
<p>The study’s authors say the findings suggest that limiting access to social media and other forms of online communication could be helpful in preventing or treating problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-casinos-turn-a-profit-from-gambling"><a href="#How-do-casinos-turn-a-profit-from-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How do casinos turn a profit from gambling?"></a>How do casinos turn a profit from gambling?</h1><p>Casinos make a profit from gambling by earning more money from players than they pay out in winnings. This is done by setting the odds of winning against players, so that the house always has an edge. In fact, casinos make such a large profit from gambling that it is illegal for them to operate in some areas.</p>
<p>The way casinos set the odds of winning against players is by using mathematics. This is called probability theory, and it is used to calculate how likely it is for different combinations of symbols to appear on the reels of a slot machine, or for numbers to be drawn from a roulette wheel. The house can then set the odds at any percentage it wants, but typically sets them at around 2-5%. This means that for every $100 bet, the casino will earn around $2-5 in profit.</p>
<p>Now, while casinos do make a lot of money from gambling, they are not immune to losses. In fact, casinos regularly have to payout large sums of money in winnings. However, as long as the house has an edge over players, they will always make a profit in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-social-media-plays-a-role-in-promoting-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Study-finds-that-social-media-plays-a-role-in-promoting-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that social media plays a role in promoting gambling addiction"></a>Study finds that social media plays a role in promoting gambling addiction</h1><p>The study, which was carried out by researchers at The University of Oxford, found that social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter were linked with an increased likelihood of developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In the study, which is to be published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, researchers analyzed data from nearly 5,000 people who had developed a gambling problem. They looked at how often participants used social media sites and whether they showed signs of risky behaviour online, such as posting pictures of themselves gambling or bragging about their winnings.</p>
<p>The findings showed that those who used social media more often were more likely to develop a gambling addiction. In particular, using Facebook or Twitter was associated with a two-fold increase in the likelihood of developing a gambling problem.</p>
<p>Participants who showed signs of risky behaviour online were also more likely to develop a gambling addiction. For example, those who posted pictures or mentioned gambling on social media were almost three times more likely to develop a problem.</p>
<p>Dr Lucy Razzall, lead author of the study, said: “Our findings suggest that social media plays an important role in promoting problem gambling. This is particularly worrying given the growing use of social media among young people.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors recommend that social media companies should do more to discourage risky behaviour among their users. They also suggest that parents talk to their children about the dangers of gambling and how to stay safe online.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-could-be-caused-by-brain-changes-study-suggests"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-could-be-caused-by-brain-changes-study-suggests" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction could be caused by brain changes, study suggests"></a>Gambling addiction could be caused by brain changes, study suggests</h1><p>Gambling addiction could be caused by brain changes that make people more impulsive and reward-driven, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that people with gambling addiction had differences in their brains’ white matter compared to healthy people.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study found that people with gambling addiction had less white matter in a region of the brain called the left anterior cingulate cortex. This region is involved in impulse control and decision making.</p>
<p>“Our findings provide evidence that changes in white matter integrity may be important for understanding why some individuals develop gambling addictions,” said study author Dr. Joshua Buckholtz.</p>
<p>“We hope that this research will help us to develop better interventions for preventing and treating gambling addiction.”</p>
<h1 id="Does-legalising-gambling-make-it-more-addictive"><a href="#Does-legalising-gambling-make-it-more-addictive" class="headerlink" title="Does legalising gambling make it more addictive?"></a>Does legalising gambling make it more addictive?</h1><p>There is no one clear answer to whether or not legalising gambling makes it more addictive. Some people believe that by making it legal, it can be better regulated and that this will help in minimising any potential problems related to addiction. Others feel that making gambling legal will simply lead to more people becoming addicted to it.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that need to be taken into account when looking at the question of whether legalising gambling makes it more addictive. These include the fact that different forms of gambling can have different levels of addictiveness, as well as the social and personal factors that may make someone more likely to develop a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One study that looked at this question found that there was no significant difference in the level of addiction between countries where gambling was legal and those where it was illegal. However, this study did find that there was a higher level of problem gambling in countries where gambling was legal. This suggests that there is a risk of addiction for some people when gambling is made legal, but it is not clear whether this is because legalisation leads to increased levels of addiction or if those who are more likely to become addicted are simply more likely to gamble when it is legalised.</p>
