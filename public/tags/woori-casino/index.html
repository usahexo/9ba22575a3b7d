<p>Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil has been fined £10 million by the English Football Association for violating its betting rules. The German international was found to have placed bets on football matches using a Microgaming sportsbook.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Ozil has been in trouble with the FA. In October of last year, he was banned for one game and fined £25,000 for making a Nazi salute in celebration of a goal he scored.</p>
<p>Arsenal released a statement saying that they “condemn Ozil’s actions in the strongest possible terms”. The club also said that they would be imposing their own internal disciplinary measures on the player.</p>
<p>Microgaming also released a statement, saying that they “do not tolerate any form of cheating or fraudulent behaviour”. The company added that they are working closely with the FA to ensure that all betting regulations are adhered to.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Beckham alleged that Microgaming withheld payments owed to him as part of a promotional deal. The former England captain also criticised the company for refusing to allow him to withdraw winnings from his account.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Friday, Microgaming denied all of Beckham’s allegations, insisting that the company had “always acted fairly and responsibly” towards him. The statement went on to say that the payments withheld from Beckham were in fact part of an advance on future royalties, and not salary payments as he had claimed.</p>
<p>Microgaming also claimed that Beckham had been fully aware of the terms of the promotional deal involved and that he had never requested to withdraw any winnings from his account.</p>
<h1 id="Footballer-loses-12-million-pounds-in-gambling-scandal"><a href="#Footballer-loses-12-million-pounds-in-gambling-scandal" class="headerlink" title="Footballer loses 12 million pounds in gambling scandal"></a>Footballer loses 12 million pounds in gambling scandal</h1><p>One of the world’s best football players has lost nearly 12 million pounds in a gambling scandal. The player, who has not been identified, is said to have bet on soccer matches and other sporting events over a four-year period.</p>
<p>It is believed that he lost most of the money while betting on games in Asia. The revelation is a major embarrassment for the player, who is one of the top earners in global football.</p>
<p>He was said to have placed high-value bets with online bookmakers, including some that were not even licensed in Britain. In total, he is thought to have lost around £11.7 million ($15 million).</p>
<p>The news comes as a major blow to the player, who is currently recovering from a serious knee injury. He was sidelined for several months after undergoing surgery in November.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the player has confirmed that he lost money through gambling, but refused to give any further details. The spokesman added that the player is now “working hard to rectify the issue”.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the player will face any disciplinary action from his club or governing body over the gambling revelations.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-CEO-responds-to-allegations-of-insider-trading"><a href="#Microgaming-CEO-responds-to-allegations-of-insider-trading" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming CEO responds to allegations of insider trading"></a>Microgaming CEO responds to allegations of insider trading</h1><p>Microgaming CEO, John Alexander, has spoken out in response to allegations of insider trading.</p>
<p>The allegations surfaced earlier this month, when it was revealed that a number of Microgaming employees had sold their shares in the company shortly before its share price fell by 14%.</p>
<p>Alexander insisted that the company acted lawfully at all times, and that the employees who sold their shares did so independently and without knowing about the forthcoming price crash.</p>
<p>“We have done nothing wrong,” said Alexander. “Our employees are free to sell their shares at any time, and they were not aware of any information that would have led them to believe that the share price would fall.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that he was confident that the matter would be resolved quickly and positively.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Microgaming has been embroiled in a controversy surrounding insider trading. In 2007, two employees were charged with insider trading after they sold £1.5 million worth of shares shortly before the company announced poor financial results.</p>
<h1 id="Footballer-sacked-after-spending-12-million-on-Microgaming"><a href="#Footballer-sacked-after-spending-12-million-on-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="Footballer sacked after spending 12 million on Microgaming"></a>Footballer sacked after spending 12 million on Microgaming</h1><p>A Premier League footballer has been sacked by his club after spending 12 million pounds in just two years on Microgaming casino games.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old England international is believed to have lost the money playing games such as Mega Moolah, Major Millions and Tunzamunni at online casinos.</p>
<p>After his high-rolling ways were uncovered by the club’s board, the player was given the boot and forced to pay back the millions he had squandered.</p>
<p>Microgaming is a software provider for online casinos that offer a wide range of games, including slots, roulette and blackjack. The company has become popular with players thanks to its huge jackpots, which can often reach into the millions of pounds.</p>
