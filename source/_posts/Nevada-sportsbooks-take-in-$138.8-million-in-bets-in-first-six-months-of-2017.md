#  Nevada sportsbooks take in $138.8 million in bets in first six months of 2017

Nevada sportsbooks took in a record $138.8 million in bets in the first six months of 2017, up 3.5 percent from the same period a year ago.

The amount wagered on all sporting events, from football to tennis, was more than $1.3 billion, with the casinos keeping an overall hold of 8.8 percent, or about $118 million.

In Nevada, the legal gambling age is 21.

The amount wagered on NFL games accounted for nearly half of all bets placed in the state at $65.5 million. The majority of that was bet on the outcome of games, but $10.9 million was bet on proposition (prop) bets, which are wagers made on individual players or particular aspects of a game such as how many yards a running back will gain or how many touchdowns a team will score.

As has been the case in recent years, basketball was the second-most popular sport to bet on in Nevada, with nearly $33 million wagered during the first half of 2017. Baseball was third with nearly $26 million wagered.

#  Pari-mutuel betting could come to Michigan by 2019

Michigan residents could be placing bets on horse races by 2019 if state lawmakers approve a measure that would allow for pari-mutuel betting.

The proposed legislation was announced last week by State Senator Wayne Schmidt and State Representative Holly Hughes. The proposed law would allow licensed gambling operators to offer betting on horse races at state-licensed casinos, racetracks, and off-track betting sites.

“This is an exciting opportunity to bring additional revenue to the state and create new jobs while giving Michigan residents another entertainment option,” said Hughes in a statement.

Proponents of the bill say that it could generate up to $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. The money would be used to fund education initiatives, road repairs, and other important programs.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social ills. They also worry that it could cannibalize revenue from the state’s existing lottery and casino businesses.

The proposed bill is currently being considered by the Michigan Senate Committee on Regulatory Reform. If approved, it will then move on to the full Senate for a vote.

#  New Jersey takes first step towards legalizing sports gambling

New Jersey has taken the first step towards legalizing sports gambling in the state, with a bill being introduced to the state legislature.

The proposed bill would allow casinos and racetracks in New Jersey to offer sports betting, with the revenue generated from this activity being used to fund statewide education programs.

If the bill is passed, it would mark a major change in policy for New Jersey, which is currently banned from offering sports betting under a federal law from 1992.

However, there is strong support for legalization of sports gambling in New Jersey, with polls indicating that around 60% of residents are in favor of it.

This support is thought to be partly driven by the fact that New Jersey has been losing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue due to its ban on sports betting.

It is also hoped that legalization of sports gambling will help create new jobs and attract more tourists to the state.

#  Pennsylvania moves closer to legalizing sports betting

In a stunning reversal, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to legalize sports betting in the state.

The vote was 180-20 in favor of the bill, sending it to the Senate for approval.

Governor Tom Wolf has already said that he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.

Pennsylvania is now the fourth state to legalize sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi.

The bill would allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with bets being taken both online and at physical locations.

Pennsylvania is thought to be a major market for sports betting, thanks to its proximity to New Jersey and Delaware, both of which have legalized sports betting.

#  Delaware to begin taking legal sports bets on August 6th

Delaware is all set to start taking sports bets on August 6th, becoming the first state outside Nevada to do so.

The Delaware Gaming Commission has announced that three casinos in the state - Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway - will offer both in-person and online sports betting starting from Monday.

The commission also revealed that betting on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey and soccer will be available at the three casinos. Bettors will also be able to bet on other sports, such as golf and auto racing.

Commission Chair Lisa Green said that they were "thrilled" to offer legal sports betting in Delaware. She added that the commission is committed to ensuring that the new industry meets the highest standards for player protection and responsible gaming.

Governor John Carney echoed these sentiments, saying that the legalization of sports betting in Delaware would create new jobs and generate additional revenue for the state. He added that it would also make Delaware more competitive with other states looking to legalize sports betting.
