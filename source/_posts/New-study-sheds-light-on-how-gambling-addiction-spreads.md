#  New study sheds light on how gambling addiction spreads

A new study has shed light on how gambling addiction spreads, and the findings could have important implications for prevention and treatment.

The study, which was published in the journal <em>PLOS One</em>, looked at how social media and other forms of online communication can contribute to problem gambling.

Researchers analyzed data from a survey of more than 2,000 people who had either a problem with gambling or were considered at risk of developing a problem. They looked at how participants used social media and other forms of online communication, as well as how much time they spent on these activities.

The findings showed that those who spent more time on social media and other forms of online communication were more likely to have a problem with gambling. In particular, using social media to communicate with friends about gambling was linked with an increased risk of developing a problem.

The study's authors say the findings suggest that limiting access to social media and other forms of online communication could be helpful in preventing or treating problem gambling.

#  How do casinos turn a profit from gambling?

Casinos make a profit from gambling by earning more money from players than they pay out in winnings. This is done by setting the odds of winning against players, so that the house always has an edge. In fact, casinos make such a large profit from gambling that it is illegal for them to operate in some areas.

The way casinos set the odds of winning against players is by using mathematics. This is called probability theory, and it is used to calculate how likely it is for different combinations of symbols to appear on the reels of a slot machine, or for numbers to be drawn from a roulette wheel. The house can then set the odds at any percentage it wants, but typically sets them at around 2-5%. This means that for every $100 bet, the casino will earn around $2-5 in profit.

Now, while casinos do make a lot of money from gambling, they are not immune to losses. In fact, casinos regularly have to payout large sums of money in winnings. However, as long as the house has an edge over players, they will always make a profit in the long run.

#  Study finds that social media plays a role in promoting gambling addiction

The study, which was carried out by researchers at The University of Oxford, found that social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter were linked with an increased likelihood of developing a gambling addiction.

In the study, which is to be published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, researchers analyzed data from nearly 5,000 people who had developed a gambling problem. They looked at how often participants used social media sites and whether they showed signs of risky behaviour online, such as posting pictures of themselves gambling or bragging about their winnings.

The findings showed that those who used social media more often were more likely to develop a gambling addiction. In particular, using Facebook or Twitter was associated with a two-fold increase in the likelihood of developing a gambling problem.

Participants who showed signs of risky behaviour online were also more likely to develop a gambling addiction. For example, those who posted pictures or mentioned gambling on social media were almost three times more likely to develop a problem.

Dr Lucy Razzall, lead author of the study, said: “Our findings suggest that social media plays an important role in promoting problem gambling. This is particularly worrying given the growing use of social media among young people.”

The study’s authors recommend that social media companies should do more to discourage risky behaviour among their users. They also suggest that parents talk to their children about the dangers of gambling and how to stay safe online.

#  Gambling addiction could be caused by brain changes, study suggests

Gambling addiction could be caused by brain changes that make people more impulsive and reward-driven, a new study suggests.

The study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that people with gambling addiction had differences in their brains' white matter compared to healthy people.

Specifically, the study found that people with gambling addiction had less white matter in a region of the brain called the left anterior cingulate cortex. This region is involved in impulse control and decision making.

"Our findings provide evidence that changes in white matter integrity may be important for understanding why some individuals develop gambling addictions," said study author Dr. Joshua Buckholtz.

"We hope that this research will help us to develop better interventions for preventing and treating gambling addiction."

#  Does legalising gambling make it more addictive?

There is no one clear answer to whether or not legalising gambling makes it more addictive. Some people believe that by making it legal, it can be better regulated and that this will help in minimising any potential problems related to addiction. Others feel that making gambling legal will simply lead to more people becoming addicted to it.

There are a number of factors that need to be taken into account when looking at the question of whether legalising gambling makes it more addictive. These include the fact that different forms of gambling can have different levels of addictiveness, as well as the social and personal factors that may make someone more likely to develop a gambling addiction.

One study that looked at this question found that there was no significant difference in the level of addiction between countries where gambling was legal and those where it was illegal. However, this study did find that there was a higher level of problem gambling in countries where gambling was legal. This suggests that there is a risk of addiction for some people when gambling is made legal, but it is not clear whether this is because legalisation leads to increased levels of addiction or if those who are more likely to become addicted are simply more likely to gamble when it is legalised.
