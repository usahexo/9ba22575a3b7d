#  Ethiopia Prepares to Deal Out Blackjack at the Casino! 

Ethiopia is planning to build the first casino in the country and has issued a tender for interested investors. The casino will be located in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and is expected to attract tourists from all over Africa.

Ethiopia is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Africa, thanks to its diverse landscape and rich culture. The new casino will undoubtedly boost tourism even further, and create jobs for locals.

The Ethiopian government is adamant that the casino project will be a success, and it has already issued a number of guidelines for interested investors. For example, the casino must be foreigner-owned, with at least 51% ownership by foreigners. It must also have a minimum floor area of 1,000 square meters, and offer at least 50 gaming tables and 100 slot machines.

In addition to gambling facilities, the casino complex must also include a hotel, restaurants, bars, and other leisure facilities. The Ethiopian government has said that it will provide all necessary security for the casino complex, ensuring that visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience.

The announcement of the new casino has generated a lot of excitement among Ethiopians. Many see it as an opportunity to make some extra money and enjoy themselves at the same time. There are already plans for how to spend the winnings â€“ new cars, luxury holidays abroad, etc.

The opening of the new casino is scheduled for 2019, so there's still plenty of time to get excited!

#  Blackjack Dealer from Ethiopia is a Rising Star at Casino tables! 

In the world of casino games, Blackjack is one of the most popular. Players can beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on their hand, or by having their hand total be closer to 21 than the dealer's hand total. At many casinos, Blackjack is also one of the games with the lowest house edge, which means that players have a better chance of winning when playing Blackjack as opposed to other casino games. 

When it comes to Blackjack dealers, there are a few key things that players look for in order to determine whether or not a dealer is good at the game. One of these things is how fast the dealer deals out the cards - good dealers should be able to deal out cards quickly and efficiently without causing any confusion at the table. Another thing that players look for is how well the dealer manages their chips - good dealers will keep their chips neatly stacked in front of them, while bad dealers tend to throw their chips around carelessly. 

One Blackjack dealer who has been getting a lot of attention lately is Betelhem Dibaba from Ethiopia. Dibaba has only been working as a Blackjack dealer for about a year, but she has already become one of the top dealers at her casino. She attributes her success partly to her strict training regimen - every day, she practices dealing out cards for hours on end until she gets it perfect. In addition to her skillful dealing, Dibaba also has a pleasant demeanor which puts players at ease. Many players have commented on how nice it is to have a female dealer - particularly one who is friendly and easy to talk to. 

Dibaba's skills have caught the attention of some major casinos, and she has been asked to work at some high-profile events in the near future. She is excited about the opportunity to expand her skills and meet new people, and she plans on continuing her diligent practice so that she can maintain her reputation as one of the best Blackjack dealers in the business.

#  Ethiopian Blackjack Dealer Wins Over Players with Strategy! 

In a small casino in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an unknown blackjack dealer has taken the town by storm with her seemingly impeccable strategy. Players who have sat at her table have all walked away disappointed, as she has yet to lose a hand.

When asked how she has managed to achieve such success, the dealer simply responds, "I just know what I'm doing." Many of the players in the casino have become suspicious of her methods and are starting to avoid her table.

But even with the increased competition, the dealer continues to win round after round. Some people are beginning to wonder if she might be using some sort of cheating technique, but so far there is no evidence to support this claim.

One player decided to do some research on his own and discovered that the dealer is actually following a very simple strategy that anyone could use. By betting conservatively and only taking calculated risks when necessary, she has been able to beat the odds time and time again.

So if you find yourself in a casino in Addis Ababa, be sure to give the blackjack dealer a try! Chances are you won't walk away a winner, but it's definitely worth a shot.
