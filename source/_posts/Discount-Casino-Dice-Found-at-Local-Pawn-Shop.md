#  Discount Casino Dice Found at Local Pawn Shop

I was rummaging through some of the older items at my local pawn shop when I came across a box of casino dice. They were all heavily discounted, so I decided to buy them.

As I got home, I couldn't help but wonder what I could do with them. I had never played craps before, but it looked like fun. After doing a little bit of research, I found out that there are a number of different ways to play the game.

I also learned that you can use the casino dice to play a number of other games as well. So, if you're looking for a fun and exciting way to spend an evening, you might want to consider giving casino dice a try.

#  Purchasing Casino Dice for Less in Las Vegas

In Las Vegas, there are many different ways to get your gambling fix. If you want to purchase casino dice, you can do so quite cheaply at some of the smaller outlets. However, before you buy, make sure that you know the game that you intend to play and the required die combinations.

First and foremost, if you're looking for a good deal on casino dice, you'll want to check out some of the smaller stores in Las Vegas. There are several tourist traps that sell overpriced casino gear, but if you venture off the main drag a bit, you can usually find a few places that have better deals. For example, on the Strip near Freemont Street, there's a small store called Favors That offer casino dice for about $5 each.

Another option for getting cheaper casino dice is to buy them online. This may not be an option if you're looking for specific colors or designs, but there are plenty of websites that sell generic sets of casino dice for much less than what you would pay in Las Vegas. In fact, if you're willing to wait for shipping, it's not uncommon to find sets of 100 or more casino dice for sale online for $15 or less.

Finally, if neither of these two options work for you, it's always possible to purchase dice from one of the larger casinos in town. However, beware that these casinos usually charge significantly more than either of the other two sources mentioned above. For example, at Caesar's Palace Dice & Chips – which is one of the most popular stores on the Strip – a set of six casino dice will run you $12.
