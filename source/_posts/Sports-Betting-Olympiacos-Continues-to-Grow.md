#  Sports Betting Olympiacos Continues to Grow

Athletes dedicate their lives to perfecting their craft so they can win medals and records for their country. Fans of sports love to cheer on their favorite athletes, teams, and countries. Bettors are no different. They love to bet on sports as well. In this article, we will take a look at the growth of sports betting in Greece and how Olympiacos is leading the way.

The ancient Greeks were among the first people to engage in sports betting. They would bet on horse races, chariot races, and other sporting events. The popularity of sports betting has only grown over the years. In recent years, online sportsbooks have seen a surge in popularity. This is due in part to the ease of use and the wide range of bets that are available.

Sports betting is not just popular in Greece. It is popular all over the world. In fact, according to a study by H2 Gambling Capital, global wagers totaled $580 billion in 2017. That’s a lot of money! The growth of sports betting shows no signs of slowing down either.

Greece is a hotbed for sports betting activity. In 2017, Greeks wagered $7 billion on sports bets, which accounted for 12% of global volume. That number is expected to continue to grow in 2018.

Why is Sports Betting So Popular in Greece?

There are several reasons why sports betting is so popular in Greece. First off, the Greek government has been very supportive of gambling and has worked hard to make it easy for residents to place bets online. Secondly, Greeks are passionate about their sports teams and love to bet on them. And lastly, Greek casinos offer some of the best odds in Europe. This combination of factors has made Greece one of the top destinations for online sports betting worldwide.

Olympiacos Leads the Way

Olympiacos Piraeus FС is one of the most successful clubs in Greek football history with 47 titles to its name including 37 championship titles, 8 cups, and 2 Super Cups.[1] As such, it comes as no surprise that Olympiacos is also leading the way when it comes to sports betting in Greece. The club has an extensive sponsorship deal with OPAP,[2] which is one of the largest gambling companies in Europe. This partnership has helped Olympiacos become one of the most popular clubs in Greece and has given its fans access to a wide range of betting options both at home and abroad.

#  Report: Global Sports Betting on Olympiacos Up 5%

The global sports betting market is continuing to grow, with a 5% increase in wagers placed on Olympiacos over the past year. The findings are from a new report by Sportradar, one of the world’s largest providers of sports data and analytics.

The report found that Olympiacos was the sixth most popular team globally for sports betting, with an overall market share of 1.5%. The club’s biggest markets for betting included Greece (78%), Cyprus (7%) and Germany (6%).

The top five teams for global sports betting were Real Madrid (2.8% share), Barcelona (2.4%), Bayern Munich (1.9%), Manchester United (1.8%) and Juventus (1.7%). Aside from Olympiacos, only four other clubs had a market share of more than 1%: Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Liverpool.

In total, the global sports betting market generated over $517 billion in turnover in 2018. This was an increase of 8% on the previous year, and is expected to grow even further in 2019. Football continues to be the most popular sport for betting, accounting for 43% of all bets placed. This was followed by basketball (19%) and American football (15%).

The Sportradar report also looked at how different regions around the world differ in their betting habits. Europe remains the biggest region for sports betting, accounting for 67% of all bettors worldwide. However, its share is declining as other regions such as Asia and North America become increasingly interested in gambling on sport.

Asia is now the second biggest region for sports betting, with a market share of 28%. This is largely due to the increasing popularity of esports, which accounts for two-thirds of all bets placed in Asia. North America has a 13% share of the global sports betting market, largely thanks to the success of American football and basketball teams in international competition.

#  Online Sports Betting on Olympiacos Hits Record High

Online sports betting on the Olympiacos Piraeus soccer team has surged to unprecedented levels in the last few weeks, with punters benefiting from a string of good results.

The team from the port city of Piraeus, which is located in Attica, is one of the top clubs in Greece and has been enjoying a resurgence in form over the past year or so. This has led to a spike in interest from bettors, with online gambling platforms reporting record levels of activity.

One site, Stoiximan, says that soccer betting on Olympiacos now accounts for around 25% of all its Greek betting activity. The company’s CEO, Dimitris Zervopoulos, was quoted as saying that this is “an unheard-of percentage for any club in Europe”.

Olympiacos’ recent successes have been built around a strong defensive unit and an attack spearheaded by Argentine international striker Lucas Pratto. The side currently sits second in the Greek Superleague table, just two points behind leaders PAOK Thessaloniki.

The team’s next match is a key clash against PAOK and it is expected that even more money will be wagered on the fixture given the high stakes involved. Online bookmakers are offering odds of 5/4 on Olympiacos securing all three points, while PAOK are priced at 23/10 to win.

#  Global Sports Betting Reaches $465 Billion; Olympiacos Accounts for 1%

The global sports betting market is booming, with a total value of $465 billion in 2018, according to a new report by the British consulting firm Sportcal. This represents a significant growth from the $414 billion recorded in 2017.

The growth has been fueled by the legalization of sports betting in a number of countries in recent years, as well as the increasing popularity of sports betting among consumers. In North America, for example, the market value more than doubled from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $48.5 billion last year.

While all segments of the sports betting market are growing, it is the online segment that is seeing the most rapid expansion. In 2018, online sports betting accounted for 62% of the global market, up from 54% in 2017.

Of course, there is a great deal of variation between different regions when it comes to sports betting markets. In Europe, for example, online betting accounts for 73% of the total market value, while in Africa it is just 12%.

Olympiacos F.C., one of Greece’s most successful football clubs, accounts for 1% of the global sports betting market.
