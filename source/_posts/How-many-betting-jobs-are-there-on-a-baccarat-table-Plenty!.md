#  How many betting jobs are there on a baccarat table? Plenty!

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino table games. It's simple to play and offers plenty of betting opportunities. Let's take a look at some of the different ways that you can bet on baccarat.

The first thing to understand about betting on baccarat is that there are only three possible outcomes - player, banker, and tie. There are no other options like black or red in roulette, for example. This means that your options for betting are more limited than in some other casino games.

One basic bet is to bet on the player or the banker. If you bet on the player and the player wins, you will be paid out 1 to 1 on your bet. If you bet on the banker and the banker wins, you will be paid out 19 to 20 on your bet. So, as you can see, there is a slight advantage to betting on the banker.

However, there are also several other bets that you can make. For example, you can bet on a tie between the player and the banker. If this happens, you will be paid out 8 to 1 on your bet. Another possibility is to bet on whether or not either the player or the banker will get a 3 card point total of 9. If this happens, you will be paid out 11 to 1 on your bet.

As you can see, there are plenty of different betting opportunities available when playing baccarat. So why not give it a try at your nearest casino? You may just find yourself winning big!
