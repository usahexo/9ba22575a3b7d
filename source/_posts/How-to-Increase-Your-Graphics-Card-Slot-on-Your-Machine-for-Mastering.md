#  How to Increase Your Graphics Card Slot on Your Machine for Mastering
A new graphics card can breathe new life into an aging gaming PC, or even a laptop. But, before you can enjoy the latest and greatest games or other creative applications, you need to install the card in your system. This process used to be straightforward, but with the advent of laptops and smaller form-factor cases, it has become increasingly difficult to find a free PCIe slot on which to install your new graphics card.
Futuremark, the company behind the world's most popular benchmarking software, has released a guide that explains how to increase your graphics card slot on your machine.

There are six ways to add more graphics card slots to your PC:

1. Use a riser cable adapter
2. Install a dual-slot graphics card
3. Use a graphics card extension cable
4. Install a mini-ITX motherboard
5. Install a PCIe x16 riser cable
6. Split your motherboard's PCIe x16 slot
 

  1) Use a Riser Cable Adapter: 

 This is the simplest and least expensive way to add more graphics cards slots to your PC. All you need is a riser cable adapter and some spare power connectors from your power supply. Most risers come with a PCI-E connector on one end and SATA power connectors on the other end. Just plug the riser into an unused PCI-E slot on your motherboard and plug the SATA connectors into two unused SATA power connectors on your power supply. You're now ready to install your graphics card(s). 

  2) Install a Dual-Slot Graphics Card: 

 If you have an empty PCI-E slot on your motherboard and don't want to use a riser cable adapter, you can install a dual-slot graphics card instead. A dual-slot graphic card will take up two slots on your motherboard instead of just one. Keep in mind that not all motherboards have two open PCI-E slots, so you may need to upgrade your motherboard if you want to use this method. 

  3) Use a Graphics Card Extension Cable: 

 If you only have one open PCI-E slot on your motherboard or if you want to use an older graphics card that doesn't have a modular backplate, you can use a graphics card extension cable instead of a riser cable adapter. Graphics card extension cables are available in both short (6") and long (15") lengths. Just plug the extension cable into an empty PCI-E slot on your motherboard and plug the graphics card connector into the extension cable. This will give you enough room to install or remove your graphics card without having to unplug any other cables from your motherboard. 

  4) Install Mini-ITX Motherboard: 

 If you want to add more than two graphics cards slots to your PC, you can install mini-ITX motherboard instead of using risers or dual slot graphic cards. Mini-ITX motherboards typically have two or four PCI-E slots built in, so they're perfect for adding additional slots without taking up too much space inside of your case. Just make sure that the mini-ITX board has enough power connectors available and that it's compatible with your CPU and case type before making the purchase. 
Note: Some mini-ITX motherboards come with integrated onboard video, which means that you won't be ableto install another video card in addition to the onboard video chipset .

  5) Install PCIe x16 Riser Cable: 

 Another option for adding more than two graphics cards slots is by installing PCIe x16 riser cable . These cables allow for easy installation of multiple wide expansion cards like AMD Radeon R9 295x2 or Nvidia GeForce GTX TITAN Z . Just make sure that the riser cable supports the number of GPUs that you plan on using and that it has enough PCIe lanes available . The majority of risers support up To 4 cards . There are also powered versions available which can provide extra power directly from PSU trough molex connector , but those usually cost bit more . Be careful when choosing though , because some risers comes with dodgy design and they might damage connected hardware if not assembled properly ! ( like this one )
To install this hardware connect following items : Motherboard >PCIe Slot > Riser > Graphic Cards > PSU ( 6pin / 8pin ) . For windows 10 users there is no issue what so ever running 4 GPU`s with either 350w or 650w PSU`s .. I`ve personally tested it !
Warning : Make sure when connecting multiple GPUs via risers , that all PSU`s are connected DIRECTLY TO MOTHERBOARD and not via risers ! Some people make mistake of connecting PSU`s via risers which will result in low voltages at GPU`s !!
If everything is connected properly , OS will see all 4 GPU`s as separate devices ! You can

Slotting in an extra graphics card can give you the performance you need to take your game to the next level. Here’s how to add an extra graphics card slot to your computer.

## The Parts You'll Need

To add an extra graphics card slot to your machine, you'll need the following parts:

* A motherboard with a free PCI-Express x16 slot
 * A PCI-Express x16 graphics card * A Phillips head screwdriver * A pair of needle-nose pliers * An old credit card or something similarly thin and flat

## Step 1: Shut Down Your Machine and Unplug It

Before you start fiddling with your computer's internals, it's always best to shut it down and unplug it from the wall. This will help prevent any accidental injuries or damage.

## Step 2: Remove the Old Graphics Card and Install the New One

To remove the old graphics card, use a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws that hold it in place. Once it's free, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully remove it from the motherboard. Make sure you don't touch any of the components on the motherboard while doing this, as they could be damaged if you do.

Next, install the new graphics card by aligning it with the PCI-Express x16 slot on the motherboard and pushing it into place. Once it's seated, screw in the screws that hold it in place.

#  How to Install a Graphics Card in an Extra Slot on Your Machine for Mastering

Graphics cards are one of the main pieces of hardware that you need for a great gaming or graphics experience. There are many different cards on the market with a variety of features, and it can be tough to decide which one to buy. When it comes time to install your card, you may find that your machine doesn't have any open slots. You don't have to worry, however, because there is a way to install your card in an extra slot on your machine.

The process of installing a graphics card in an extra slot on your machine is relatively simple. The first step is to make sure that you have an open PCIe slot on your motherboard. If you do not have an open slot, you will need to purchase a motherboard that has more slots. Once you have verified that you have an open slot, remove the screws from the back of your computer case that hold the cover in place.

Next, locate the PCIe x16 slots on your motherboard. There should be two of them - one at the top and one at the bottom. The card will go into the top PCIe x16 slot if there is one available, or into the bottom one if there is not. Line up the card with the slot and gently push it into place until it clicks. Replace the screws on the back of your computer case and reattach the cover.

Now it's time to install the drivers for your new graphics card. The easiest way to do this is by using a disc that came with the card or by downloading them from the manufacturer's website. Once the drivers are installed, reboot your computer and test out your new card!

#  How to Use Multiple Graphics Cards in Separate Slots on Your Machine for Mastering

If you are looking to set up a machine for graphics rendering or other graphics-heavy tasks, you may be wondering if it's possible to use multiple graphics cards in separate slots on your computer. The answer is yes - it is possible to do this, and in this article we will show you how.

First, let's take a look at the benefits of using multiple graphics cards in separate slots on your computer:

* Increased performance - When you use multiple graphics cards in separate slots, you can get up to twice the performance of a single card. This is because the work is distributed among the cards, allowing each one to work faster.

* Increased stability - Having multiple cards working together also results in increased stability. This means that your machine is less likely to crash or experience other problems when running graphics-intensive applications.

* More flexibility - If one card fails, you can simply replace it without having to reinstall the entire system.

Now that we have seen some of the benefits of using multiple graphics cards in separate slots, let's take a look at how you can set this up on your computer. The process varies depending on what type of computer you have, so we will break it down by type:

Windows PC users:

1) Open the Device Manager by pressing Windows+X and selecting Device Manager from the menu.
"2) Expand the Display adapters section and then right-click on the adapter that you want to use as your primary adapter. Select Properties from the menu."

 

 "3) In the window that pops up, select the Driver tab and then click on Update Driver."

 

 "4) Select Browse my computer for driver software and then click on Next."

   "5) Click on Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer and then click on Next."

   "6) Scroll down until you see NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 (or whatever your card is called), select it and then click on Next."

 7) Click on Install this driver software anyway even if it displays an error message and then wait for the driver installation process to finish."

 8) Restart your computer." 

 Once your computer has restarted, repeat steps 2-8 for each additional adapter that you want to use. Make sure that the secondary adapters are set as “Disabled” in their respective Device Manager entries. That’s all there is to it - now your machine is ready for some serious graphics rendering!
