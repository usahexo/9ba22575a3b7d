#  How to Clean Poker Table Felt like a Pro

Cleaning poker table felt doesn't have to be difficult, but there are a few tricks to make the job easier. Whether you're trying to remove stubborn stains or just give the entire surface a good clean, this guide will help you do it like a pro.

1. Start by vacuuming the table top to get rid of any loose dirt or debris. This will make the next step a lot easier.

2. Next, mix up a bucket of hot water and laundry detergent. The hotter the water, the better, as it will penetrate any stains better.

3. Dip a soft cloth into the detergent mixture and start scrubbing the table top in a circular motion. Be sure to pay special attention to any particularly dirty areas.

4. Rinse the cloth frequently and change the water in the bucket as needed until the table top is clean. Dry it off with another soft cloth once you're finished.

5. If you notice any stubborn stains that didn't come out with regular cleaning, there are a few other methods you can try. One popular method is to use acetone nail polish remover on a cotton ball; just be sure to test this on an inconspicuous area first to make sure it doesn't damage the felt.

6. Another option is hydrogen peroxide mixed with baking soda; again, test this in an inconspicuous area before using it on the entire table top.

7. Finally, if all else fails, you can buy a commercial stain remover specifically designed for poker table felt from your local sporting goods store or online retailer.

Now it's time to get to work! Fill the bucket with hot water and add a few squirts of dish soap. Stir the water until the soap is dissolved.

Next, wet your rag in the water and start scrubbing the felt. Be sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. Scrub gently at first, then apply more pressure as needed.

When you're finished scrubbing, rinse the rag in the bucket and wipe down the entire table surface. Rinse the bucket and dump out any excess water. Let the table dry completely before using it again.
