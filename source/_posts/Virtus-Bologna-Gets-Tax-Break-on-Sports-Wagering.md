#  Virtus Bologna Gets Tax Break on Sports Wagering

In a move that has surprised many in the sports world, the Virtus Bologna basketball team was granted a tax break on sports betting by the Italian government. The team, which has been struggling in recent years, was thought to be one of the least likely recipients of such a break.

The Virtus Bologna team is based in the city of Bologna, in northern Italy. The team has a long and storied history, including a championship win in 1990. In more recent years, however, the team has struggled both on and off the court. The team finished dead last in the Italian basketball league during the 2016-2017 season, and was facing mounting financial difficulties.

In order to try and revive the Virtus Bologna team, its management petitioned for and received a tax break on sports betting from the Italian government. The break allows the team to receive a percentage of profits from sports betting instead of having to pay taxes on those profits. This could provide a much-needed financial boost for the Virtus Bologna team as it looks to improve its performance on the court.

The decision to award such a break to Virtus Bologna was seen as somewhat controversial by some observers. It is unclear exactly why the team was selected for this break when other professional sports teams in Italy were not. Some have speculated that this may be an attempt by the Italian government to curry favor with local voters in advance of upcoming elections.

Regardless of the reasons behind it, this tax break should provide a much-needed financial boost to Virtus Bologna as it looks to improve its performance on the court. This could help revive interest in one of Italy's oldest and most storied sports teams.

#  NY Gives Virtus Bologna a Tax Break for Sports Betting

Shortly after the New York State Gaming Commission announced that it was giving a tax break to Virtus Bologna, an Italian professional basketball team, for opening a sports betting operation at Madison Square Garden, the backlash began.

Some argue that the tax break is unfair to other businesses in the area and sets a bad precedent. But there may be more to it than that.

The decision comes as no surprise, as New York State has been trying to attract new sports betting operations since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting last year. The state is expecting to bring in $1 billion in annual revenue from sports betting, and so it is offering tax breaks and other incentives to get teams to set up shop there.

It's not just Virtus Bologna that is benefiting from this. The New York Rangers and Madison Square Garden also stand to gain from the tax break. In fact, the Rangers are even co-owners of the new Virtus Bologna sports betting operation.

This has led to some criticism of the state government, with some saying that it is giving out too many tax breaks and favors to wealthy teams and businesses. Others argue that this is simply good business sense, as it will bring in much-needed revenue to New York State.

It remains to be seen how successful these new sports betting operations will be. But one thing is for sure: there is a lot of money at stake, and everyone involved is hoping to profit handsomely from it.

#  New York Announces Tax Incentive for Virtus Bologna's Sports Wagering

_The New York State Gaming Commission has announced a new tax incentive program for prospective sports betting operators in the state._

_The program, which is set to take effect on January 1st, 2019, offers a 10% tax rate on gross gaming revenues for the first three years of operations. After that, the rate increases to 20%._

_"This is an important step forward in our efforts to bring sports betting to New York," said Gaming Commission Chairman James P. Griffin."We are confident that this incentive will help attract high-quality operators to our market."_

_The announcement comes on the heels of the US Supreme Court's decision in May to repeal the federal ban on sports betting nationwide._

_Several states have since moved to legalize sports betting within their borders, including New York._

_Virtus Bologna, one of Italy's leading sports betting operators, has already announced plans to open a sportsbook at Resorts World Casino in Queens. The company is also exploring opportunities in other states where sports betting is legal._

#  NY Governor Announces Tax Breaks for Virtus Bologna's Sports Betting Operation

Governor Cuomo has announced a new tax break for the Virtus Bologna professional basketball team's new sports betting operation. The team, which is owned by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, will be exempt from paying state and local taxes on its profits for the first five years of operation.

Adelson, who also owns the Las Vegas Sands casino empire, is a major player in the world of sports betting. He has been lobbying hard for years to get the federal government to legalize sports betting nationwide. Earlier this year, he scored a major victory when the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting.

Now that sports betting is legal in most states, Adelson has been busy setting up shop. His company, Las Vegas Sands, has already acquired two major casinos in Pennsylvania - the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem and the Marina Casino - and plans to open a third next year. Virtus Bologna is his latest venture into the world of professional sports betting.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to addiction and gambling-related crime. But Adelson and other proponents say that it will bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states and create jobs. They also argue that it will help keep people from using illegal bookmakers, which can be dangerous because they often employ shady characters who are known for using violence to collect debts.

Cuomo apparently agrees with this assessment, as his new tax break for Virtus Bologna's sports betting operation is designed to help make it more competitive with illegal bookmakers. "This legislation will help ensure that New Yorkers have access to safe and legal sports betting, while providing a level playing field for our businesses," Cuomo said in a statement announcing the new tax break.

It remains to be seen whether Adelson's new venture into professional sports betting will be successful. But if it is, other states may follow New York's lead in offering tax breaks to encourage him to set up shop there instead of elsewhere.

#  NY to Give Virtus Bologna a Tax break on Sports Wagering

Governor Cuomo announced a new proposal that would give the Italian basketball team Virtus Bologna a tax break on sports wagering. The Governor is hopeful that this move will create new jobs and economic opportunities in the State of New York.

"This proposal is about boosting our economy and creating jobs," Governor Cuomo said. "It's also about growing tourism and recreation in New York. We are fortunate to have some of the best sports teams in the world, and this proposal will make it easier for fans to cheer them on."

Bologna is one of Italy's most popular basketball teams, and they often compete in Europe's top basketball league, the EuroLeague. The team is also known for their passionate fan base.

If approved, the tax break would allow Bologna to avoid paying taxes on any income generated from sports betting operations at their new arena, which is currently under construction. This would include ticket sales, concessions, parking, and other related income.

The move could potentially bring millions of dollars in new revenue to New York. It would also help support the team's efforts to compete at a high level and bring more tourists to the state.
